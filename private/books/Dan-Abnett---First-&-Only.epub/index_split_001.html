<h2 title="PART TWO, **FORTIS BINARY FORGE WORLD**" id="calibre_toc_2" class="calibre6">PART TWO</h2>
<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC"><b class="calibre7">FORTIS BINARY FORGE WORLD</b></h3>

<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">One</b></p>
<p class="calibre2">The night sky was matt and dark, like the material of the fatigues they wore, day after day. The dawn stabbed in, as silent and sudden as a knife-wound, welling up a dull redness through the black cloth of the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Eventually the sun rose, casting raw amber light down over the trench lines. The star was big, heavy and red, like a rotten, roasted fruit. Dawn lightning crackled a thousand kilometres away. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Colm Corbec woke, acknowledged briefly the thousand aches and snarls in his limbs and frame, and rolled out of his billet in the trench dugout. His great, booted feet kissed into the grey slime of the trench floor where the duckboards didn't meet. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">Corbec was a large man on the wrong side of forty, built like an ox and going to fat. </p>
<p class="calibre2">His broad and hairy forearms were decorated with blue spiral tattoos and his beard was thick and shaggy. He wore the black webbing and fatigues of the Tanith and also the ubiquitous camo-doak which had become their trademark. He also shared the pale complexion, black hair and blue eyes of his people. He was the colonel of the Tanith First and Only, the so-called Gaunt's Ghosts. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He yawned. Down the trench, under the frag-sack and gabion breastwork and the spools of rusting razor wire, the Ghosts awoke too. There were coughs, gasps, soft yelps as nightmares became real in the light of waking. Matches struck under the low bevel of the parapet; firearms were un-swaddled and the damp cleaned off. Firing mechanisms were slammed in and out. Food parcels were unhooked from their vermin-proof positions up on the billet roofs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Shuffling in the ooze, Corbec stretched and cast an eye down the long, zigzag traverses of the trench to see where the picket sentries were returning, pale and weary, asleep on their feet. The twinkling lights of the vast communication up-link masts flashed eleven kilometres behind them, rising between the rusting, shell-pocked roofs of the gargantuan shipyard silos and the vast Titan fabrication bunkers and foundry sheds of the Adeptus Mechanicus tech-priesthood. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The dark stealth capes of the picket sentries, the distinctive uniform of the Tanith First and Only, were lank and stiff with dried mud. Their replacements at the picket, bleary eyed and puffy, slapped them on the arms as they passed, exchanging jokes and cigarettes. The night sentries, though, were too weary to be forthcoming. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They were ghosts, returning to their graves, Corbec thought. As are we all. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In a hollow under the trench wall, Mad Larkin, the first squad's wiry sniper, was cooking up something that approximated caffeine in a battered tin tray over a fusion burner. The acrid stink hooked Corbec by the nostrils. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Give me some of that, Larks,' the colonel said, squelching across the trench. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Larkin was a skinny, stringy, unhealthily pale man in his fifties with three silver hoops through his left ear and a purple-blue spiral-wyrm tattoo on his sunken right cheek. He offered up a misshapen metal cup. There was a fragile look, of fatigue and fear, in his wrinkled eyes. This morning, do you reckon? This morning?' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Corbec pursed his lips, enjoying the warmth of the cup in his hefty paw. 'Who knowsâ€¦' His voice trailed off. </p>
<p class="calibre2">High in the orange troposphere, a matched pair of Imperial fighters shrieked over, curved around the lines and plumed away north. Fire smoke lifted from Adeptus Mechanicus work-temples on the horizon, great cathedrals of industry, now burning from within. A second later, the dry wind brought the crump of detonations. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">Corbec watched the fighters go and sipped his drink. It was almost unbearably disgusting. 'Good stuff/ he muttered to Larkin. </p>
<p class="calibre2">A kilometre off, down the etched zigzag of the trench line, Trooper Fulke was busily going crazy. Major Rawne, the regiment's second officer, was woken by the sound of a lasgun firing at close range, the phosphorescent impacts ringing into frag-sacks and mud. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rawne spun out of his cramped billet as his adjutant, Feygor, stumbled up nearby. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There were shouts and oaths from the men around them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Fulke had seen vermin, the ever-present vermin, attacking his rations, chewing into the plastic seals with their snapping lizard mouths. As Rawne blundered down the trench, the animals skittered away past him, lopping on their big, rabbit-legs, their lice-ridden pelts smeared flat with ooze. Fulke was firing his lasgun on full auto into his sleeping cavity under the bulwark, screaming obscenities at the top of his fractured voice. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Feygor got there first, wrestling the weapon from the bawling trooper. Fulke turned his fists on the adjutant, mashing his nose, splashing up grey mud-water with his scrambling boots. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rawne slid in past Feygor, and put Fulke out with a hook to the jaw. There was a crack of bone and the trooper went down, whimpering, in the drainage gully. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Assemble a firing squad detail,' Rawne spat at the bloody Feygor unceremoniously and stalked back to his dugout. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Trooper Bragg wove back to his bunk. A huge man, unarguably the largest of the Ghosts, he was a peaceable, simple soul. They called him Try Again' Bragg because of his terrible aim. He'd been on picket all night and now his bed was singing a lullaby he couldn't resist. He slammed into young Trooper Caffran at a turn in the dugout and almost knocked the smaller man flat. Bragg hauled him up, his weariness damming his apologies in his mouth. 'No harm done, Try,' Caffran said. 'Get to your billet.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Bragg blundered on. Two paces more and he'd even forgotten what he'd done. He simply had an afterimage memory of an apology he should have made to a good friend. Fatigue was total. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran ducked down into the crevice of the command dugout, just off the third communication trench. There was a thick polyfibre shield over the door, and layers of anti-gas curtaining. He knocked twice and then pulled back the heavy drapes and dropped into the deep cavity. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Two</b></p>
<p class="calibre2">The officer's dugout was deep, accessed only by an aluminium ladder lashed to the wall. Inside, the light was a frosty white from the sodium burners. The floor was well-made of duck-boards and there were even such marks of civilisation as shelves, books, charts and an aroma of decent caffeine. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sliding down into the command burrow, Caffran noticed first Brin Milo, the sixteen year-old mascot the Ghosts had acquired at their Founding. Word was, Milo had been rescued personally from the fires of their homeworld by the commissar himself, and this bond had led him to his status of regimental musician and adjutant to their senior officer. Caffran didn't like to be around the boy much. There was something about his youth and his brightness of eye that reminded him of the world they had lost. It was ironic: back on Tanith with only a year or two between them, they like as not would have been friends. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Milo was setting out breakfast on a small camp table. The smell was delicious: cooking eggs and ham and some toasted bread. Cafrran envied the commissar, his position and his luxuries. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Has the commissar slept well?' Caffran asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'He hasn't slept at all,' Milo replied. 'He's been up through the night reviewing reconnaissance transmissions from the orbital watch.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran hesitated in the entranceway to the burrow, clutching his sealed purse of communiques. He was a small man, for a Tanith, and young, with shaved black hair and a blue dragon tattoo on his temple. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Come in, sit yourself down.' At first, Caffran thought Milo had spoken. But it was the commissar himself. Ibram Gaunt emerged from the rear chamber of the dugout looking pale and drawn. He was dressed in his uniform trousers and a white singlet with regimental braces strapped tight in place. He gestured Caffran to the seat opposite him at the small camp table and then swung down onto the other stool. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran hesitated again and then sat at the place indicated. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt was a tall, hard man in his forties, and his lean face utterly matched his name. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Trooper Caffran admired the commissar enormously and had studied his previous actions at Balhaut, at Formal Prime, his service with the Hyrkan Eighth, even his majestic command of the disaster that was Tanith. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt seemed more tired than Caffran had ever seen, but he trusted this man to bring them through. If anyone could redeem the Ghosts it would be Ibram Gaunt. He was a rare beast, a political officer who had been granted full regimental command and the brevet rank of colonel. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'I'm sorry to interrupt your breakfast, commissar,' Caffran said, sitting uneasily at the camp table, fussing with the purse of communiques. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Not at all, Caffran. In fact, you're just in time to join me.' Caffran hesitated once more, not knowing if this was a joke. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">'I'm serious,' Gaunt said. "You look as hungry as I feel. And I'm sure Brin has cooked up more than enough for two.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">As if on cue, the boy produced two ceramic plates of food -mashed eggs and grilled ham with tough, toasted chunks of wheatbread. Caffran looked at the plate in front of him for a moment as Gaunt tucked into his with relish. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Go on, eat up. It's not every day you get a chance to taste officer's rations,' Gaunt said, wolfing down a forkful of eggs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran nervously picked up his own fork and began to eat. It was the best meal he'd had in sixty days. It reminded him of his days as an apprentice engineer in the wood mills of lost Tanith, back before the Founding and the Loss, of the wholesome suppers served on the long tables of the refectory after last shift. Before long, he was consuming the breakfast with as much gusto as the commissar, who smiled at him appreciatively. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The boy Milo then produced a steaming pot of thick caffeine, and it was time to talk business. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'So, what do the dispatches tell us this morning?' Gaunt started. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'I don't know, sir,' Caffran said, pulling out the communique purse and dropping it onto the tabletop in front of him. 'I just carry these things. I never ask what's in them.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt paused for a moment, chewing a mouthful of eggs and ham. He took a long sip of his steaming drink and then reached out for the purse. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran thought to look away as Gaunt unsealed the plastic envelope and read the print-out strips contained within. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'I've been up all night at that thing,' Gaunt said, gesturing over his shoulder to the green glow of the tactical communication artificer, built into the muddy wall of the command burrow. 'And it's told me nothing.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt reviewed the dispatches that spilled out of Caffran's purse. 'I bet you and the men are wondering how long we'll be dug into this hell hole,' Gaunt said. The truth is, I can't tell you. This is a war of attrition. We could be here for months.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran was by now feeling so warm and satisfied by the good meal he had just eaten the commissar could have told him his mother had been murdered by orks and he wouldn't have worried much. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Sir?' Milo's voice was a sudden intruder into the gentle calm. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt looked up. 'What is it, Brin?' he said. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'I thinkâ€¦ that isâ€¦ I think there's an attack coming.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran chuckled. 'How could you know-' he began but the commissar cut him off. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">'Somehow, Milo's sensed each attack so far before it's come. Each one. Seems he has a gift for anticipating shell-fall. Perhaps it's his young ears.' Gaunt crooked a wry grin at Cafrran. 'Do you want to argue, eh?' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran was about to answer when the first wail of shells howled in. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Three</b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt leapt to his feet, knocking the camp table over. It was the sudden motion rather than the scream of incoming shells which made Caffran leap up in shock. Gaunt was scrabbling for his side-arm, hanging in its holster on a hook by the steps. He grabbed the speech-horn of the vox-caster set, slung under the racks that held his books. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Gaunt to all units! To arms! To arms! Prepare for maximum resistance!' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran didn't wait for any further instruction. He was already up the steps and banging through the gas curtains as volleys of shells assaulted their trenches. Huge plumes of</p>
<p class="calibre2">vaporised mud spat up from the trench head behind him and the narrow gully was full of the yells of suddenly animated guardsmen. A shell whinnied down low across his position and dug a hole the size of a drop-ship behind the rear breastwork of the trench. Liquid mud drizzled down on him. Caffran pulled his lasgun from its sling and slithered up towards the top of the trench firestep. There was chaos, panic, troopers hurrying in every direction, screaming and shouting. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Was this it? Was this the final moment in the long, drawn-out conflict they had found themselves in? Caffran tried to slide up the side of the trench far enough to get a sight over the lip, across no-man's land to the enemies' emplacements which they had been locked into for the last six months. All he could see was a mist of smoke and mud. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There was a crackle of las weapons and several screams. More shells fell. One of them found the centre of a nearby communications trench. Then the screaming became real and immediate. The drizzle that fell on him was no longer water and mud. There were body parts in it. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran cursed and wiped the sight-lens of his lasgun dean of filth. Behind him he heard a shout, a powerful voice that echoed along the traverses of the trench and seemed to shake the duckboards. He looked back to see Commissar Gaunt emerging from his dugout. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt was dressed now in his full dress uniform and cap, the camo-doak of his adopted regiment swirling about his shoulders, his face a mask of bellowing rage. In one hand he held his bolt pistol and in the other his chainsword, whidi whined and sang in the early morning air. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'In the name of Tanith! Now they are on us we must fight! Hold the line and hold your fire until they come over the mud wall!' </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran felt a rejoicing in his soul. The commissar was with them and they would succeed, no matter the odds. Then something dosed down his world with a vibratory shock that blew mud up into the air and seemed to separate his spirit from his body. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The section of trench had taken a direct hit. Dozens of men were dead. Caffran lay stunned in the broken line of duck-boards and splattered mud. A hand grabbed him by the shoulder and hauled him up. Blinking he looked up to see the face of Gaunt. Gaunt looked at him with a solemn, yet inspiring gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Sleeping after a good breakfast?' the commissar enquired of the bewildered trooper. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'No sirâ€¦ Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦' </p>
<p class="calibre2">The crack of lasguns and needle lasers began to whip around them from the armoured loopholes on the trench head. Gaunt wrenched Caffran back to his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'I think the time has come/ Gaunt said, 'and I'd like all of my brave men to be in the line with me when we advance.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Spitting out grey mud, Caffran laughed. 'I'm with you, sir,' he said, 'from Tanith to whereever we end up.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran heard the whine of Gaunt's chainsword as the commissar leapt up the scaling ladder nailed into the trench wall above the firestep and yelled to his men. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Men of Tanith! Do you want to live forever?' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Their reply, loud and raucous, was lost in the barrage of shells. But Ibram Gaunt knew what they had said. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Weapons blazing, Gaunt's Ghosts went over the top and blasted their way towards glory, death or whatever else awaited them in the smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Four</b></p>
<p class="calibre2">There was a sizzling thicket of las-fire a hundred paces deep and twenty kilometres long where the advancing legions of the enemy met the Imperial Guard regiments head on. It looked for all the world like squirming nests of colonial insects bursting forth from their mounds and meeting in a chaotic mess of seething forms, lit by the incessant and incandescent sparking crossfire of their weapons. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Lord High Militant General Hechtor Dravere turned away from his tripod-mounted scope. He smoothed the faultless breast of his tunic with well-manicured hands and sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Who would that be dying down there?' he asked in his disturbingly thin, reedy voice. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Colonel Flense, field commander of the Jantine Patricians, one of the oldest and most venerated Guard regiments, got off his couch and stood smartly to attention. Flense was a tall, powerful man, the tissue of his left cheek disfigured long ago by a splash of Tyranid bio-acid. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'General?' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Thoseâ€¦ those ants down thereâ€¦' Dravere gestured idly over his shoulder. 'I wondered who they were.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Flense strode across the veranda to the chart table where a flat glass plate was illuminated from beneath with glowing indication runes. He traced a ringer across the glass, assessing the four hundred kilometres of battlefield frontline which represented the focus of the war here on Fortis Binary, a vast and ragged pattern of opposing trench systems, facing each other across a mangled deadland of cratered mud and shattered factories. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The western trenches/ he began. They are held by the Tanith First Regiment. You know them, sir: Gaunt's mob, what some of the men call "The Ghosts" I believe.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dravere wandered across to an ornate refreshment cart and poured himself a tiny cup of rich black caffeine from the gilt samovar. He sipped and for a moment sloshed the heavy fluid between his teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Flense cringed. Colonel Draker Flense had seen things in his time that would have burned through the souls of most ordinary men. He had watched legions die on the wire, he had seen men eat their comrades in a frenzy of Chaos-induced madness, he had seen planets, whole planets, collapse and die and rot. There was something about General Dravere that touched him more deeply and more repugnantly than any of that. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a pleasure to serve. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dravere swallowed at last and set aside his cup. 'So Gaunt's Ghosts get the wake-up call this morning,' he said. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Hechtor Dravere was a squat, bullish man in his sixties, balding and yet insistent upon lacquering the few remaining strands of hair across his scalp as if to prove a point. He was fleshy and ruddy, and his uniform seemed to require an entire regimental ration of starch and whitening to prepare each morning. There were medals on his chest which stuck out on a stiff brass pin. He always wore them. Flense was not entirely sure what they all represented. He had never asked. He knew that Dravere had seen at least as much as him and had taken every ounce of glory for it that he could. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes Flense resented the fact that the lord general always wore his decorations. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He supposed it was because the lord general had them and he did not. That was what it meant to be a lord general. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The ducal palace on whose veranda they now stood was miraculously intact after six months of serial bombardment</p>
<p class="calibre2">and overlooked the wide rift valley of Diemos, once the hydroelectric industrial heartland of Fortis Binary, now the axis on which the war revolved. In all directions, as far as the eye could see, sprawled the gross architecture of the manufacturing zone: the towers and hangers, the vaults and bunkers, the storage tanks and chimney stacks. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">A great ziggurat rose to the north, the brilliant gold icon of the Adeptus Mechanicus displayed on its flank. It rivalled, perhaps even surpassed, the Temple of the Ecdesiarchy, dedicated to the God-Emperor. But then, the Tech-Priests of Mars would argue this entire world was a shrine to the God-Machine Incarnate. The ziggurat had been the administrative heart of the Tech-Priests' industry on Fortis, from where they directed a workforce of nineteen billion in the production of armour and heavy weaponry for the Imperial war machine. It was a burned-out shell now. It had been the uprising's first target. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In the far hills of the valley, in fortified factories, worker habitats and material store yards, the enemy was dug in - a billion strong, a vast massed legion of daemoniac cultists. Fortis Binary was a primary Imperial forge world, muscular and energetic in its industrial production. No one knew how the Ruinous Powers had come to corrupt it, or how a huge section of the massive labour force had been infected with the taint of the Fallen Gods. But it had happened. Eight months before, almost overnight, the vast manufactory arks and furnace-plants of the Adeptus Mechanicus had been overthrown by the Chaos-corrupted workforce, once bonded to serve the machine cult. Only a scarce few of the Tech-Priests had escaped the sudden onslaught and evacuated off world. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now the massed legions of the Imperial Guard were here to liberate this world, and the action was very much determined by the location. The master-factories and tech-plants of Fortis Binary were too valuable to be stamped flat by an orbital bombardment. Whatever the cost, for the good of the Imperium, this world had to be retaken a pace at a time, by men on the ground: fighting men, Imperial Guard, soldiers who would, by the sweat of their backs, root out and destroy every last scrap of Chaos and leave the precious industries of the forge world ready and waiting for re-population. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Every few days they try us again, pushing at another line of our trenches, trying to find a weak link.' The lord general</p>
<p class="calibre2">looked back into his scope at the carnage fifteen kilometres away. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Tanith First are strong fighters, general, so I have heard.' Flense approached Dravere and stood with his hands behind hit back. The scar-tissue of his cheek pinched and twitched slightly, as it often did when he was tense. They have acquitted themselves well on a number of campaigns and Gaunt is said to be a resourceful leader.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">You know him?' the general looked up from his eye-piece, questioningly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Flense paused. 'I know o/him, sir. In the main by reputation,' he said, swallowing many truths, *but I have met him in passing. His philosophy of leadership is not in tune with mine.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">You don't like him, do you, Flense?' Dravere asked pertinently. He could read Flense like a book, and could see some deep resentment lay in the colonel's heart when it came to the subject of the infamous and heroic Commissar Gaunt. He knew what it was. He'd read the reports. He also knew Flense would never actually mention it. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">"Frankly? No, sir. He is a commissar. A political officer. But by a turn of fate, he has achieved a regimental command. Warmaster Slaydo granted him the command of the Tanith on his deathbed. I understand the role of commissars in this army, but 1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">despise his officer status. He is sympathetic where he should be inspiring, inspirational where he should be dogmatic. Butâ€¦ still and all, he is a commander we can probably trust.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dravere smiled. Flense's outburst had been from the heart, and honest, but it still diplomatically skirted the real truth. 'I mist no other commander than myself, Flense,' </p>
<p class="calibre2">the General said flatly. 'If I cannot see the victory, I will not trust it to other hands. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Your Patricians are held in reserve, am I correct?' </p>
<p class="calibre2">They are barracked in the work habitats to the west, ready to support a push on either flank.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Go to them and bring them to readiness,' the lord general said. He crossed to the chart table again and used a stylus to nark out several long sweeps of light on the glassy top. We have been held here long enough. I grow impatient. This war should have been over and done months ago. How many brigades have we committed to break the deadlock?' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Flense wasn't sure. Dravere was famously extravagant with manpower. It was his proud boast that he could choke even the</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eye of Terror if he had enough bodies to march into it. Certainly in the last few weeks, Dravere had become increasingly frustrated at the lack of advance. Flense guessed that Dravere was anxious to please Warmaster Macaroth, the new overall commander of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. Dravere and Macaroth had been rivals for Slaydo's succession. Having lost to Macaroth, Dravere probably had a lot to prove. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Like his loyalty to the new warmaster. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Flense had also heard rumours that Inquisitor Heldane, one of Dravere's most trusted associates, had come to Fortis a week before to conduct private talks with the lord general. Now it was as if Dravere yearned to move on, to be somewhere, to achieve something even grander than the conquest of a world, even a world as vital as Fortis Binary. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dravere was talking again. The Shriven have shown their hand this morning, in greater force than before, and it will take them eight or nine hours to withdraw and regroup from whatever advances they make now. Bring your regiments in from the east and cut them off. Use these Ghosts as a buffer and slice a hole into the heart of their main defences. With the will of the beloved Emperor, we may at last break this matter and press a victory.' The lord general tapped the screen with the point of the stylus as if to emphasise the non-negotiable quality of his instruction. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Flense was eager to comply. It was his determined ambition that his regiments should be fundamental in achieving the victory on Fortis Binary. The notion that Gaunt could somehow take that glory from him made him sicken, made him think of-He shook off the thought, and basked in the idea that Gaunt and his low-born scum would be used, expended, sacrificed on the enemy guns to affect his own glory. Still, Flense wavered for a second, about to leave. There was no harm in creating a litde insurance. He crossed back to the chart table and pointed a leather-gloved finger at a curve of the contours on the map. There is a wide area to cover, sir,' he said, 'and if Gaunt's men were toâ€¦ well, break with cowardice, my Patricians would be left vulnerable to both the dug in forces of die Shriven and to the retreating elements.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dravere mused on this for a moment. Cowardice: what a loaded word for Flense to use in respect to Gaunt. Then he dapped his chubby hands together as gleefully as a young child at a birthday party. 'Signals! Signals officer in here now!' </p>
<p class="calibre2">The inner door of the lounge room opened and a weary soldier hurried in, snapping his worn, but dean and polished boots together as he saluted the two officers. Dravere was busy scribing orders onto a message slate. He reviewed them once and then handed them to the soldier. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"We will bring the Vitrian Dragoons in to support the Ghosts in the hope that they will drive the Shriven host back into the flood plains. In this way, we should ensure that the fighting is held along the western flank for as long as it takes your Patricians to engage the enemy. Signal to this effect, and signal also the Tanith Commander, Gaunt. Instruct him to push on. His duty today is not merely to repel. It is to press on and use this opportunity to take the Shriven frontline trenches. Ensure that this instruction is dearly an order directly from me. There will be no faltering, tell him. No retreat. They will achieve or they will die.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Flense allowed himself an inward smile of triumph. His own back was now comfortably covered, and Gaunt had been forced into a push that would have him dead by nightfall. The soldier saluted again and made to exit. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One last thing,' Dravere said. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The soldier skidded to a halt and turned, nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dravere tapped the samovar with a chunky signet ring. 'Ask [diem to send in some fresh caffeine. This is stale.' The soldier nodded and exited. From the clunk of the ring it was clear that the big, gilt vessel was still nearly full. A regiment could drink for several days on what the General clearly intended to throw away. He managed to wait until he was out of the double doors before he spat a silent curse at the man who was orchestrating ihis bloodbath. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Flense saluted too and walked towards the door. He picked I op his peaked cap from the sideboard and carefully set it upon his head, the back of the brim first. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Praise the Emperor, lord general,' he said. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What? Oh, yes. Indeed,' Dravere said absently, as he sat back on his chaise and lit a cigar. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Five</b></p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">Kmor Rawne threw himself flat into a foxhole and almost downed in the milky water which had accumulated in its I depths. Spluttering, he pulled himself up to the lip of the crater</p>
<p class="calibre2">and took aim with his lasgun. The air all around was thick with smoke and the flashing streams of gunfire. Before he had time to fire, several more bodies crashed into the makeshift cover by his side: Trooper Neff and the platoon adjutant, Feygor, beside them Troopers Caffran, Varl and Lonegin. There was Trooper Klay as well, but he was dead. The fierce crossfire had cauterised his face before he could reach cover. None of them looked twice at Way's body in the water behind them. They had seen that sort of thing a thousand times too often. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rawne used his scope to check over the rim of the foxhole. Somewhere out there the Shriven were using some heavy weapon to support their infantry. The thick and explosive fire was cutting a wedge out of the Ghosts as they advanced. Neff was fiddling with his weapon and Rawne glanced down at him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"What's the matter, trooper?' he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There's mud in my firing mechanism, sir. I can't free it.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Feygor snatched the lasgun from the younger man, ejected the magazine and slung back the oiled cover of the ignition chamber, so that it was open and the focus rings exposed. Feygor spat into the open chamber and then slammed it shut with a clack. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then he shook it vigorously and jammed the energy magazine back into its slot. Neff watched as Feygor swung round again and lifted the gun above his head, firing i wholesale into the smoke beyond the foxhole. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Feygor tossed the weapon back to the trooper. 'See? It's working now.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Neff clutched the returned weapon and wriggled up to the lip of the hole. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'We'll be dead before we go another metre,' Lonegin said from below them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'For Feth's sake!' Trooper Varl spat. "We'll just get them ducking then.' He unhooked a dutch of grenades from his webbing and tossed them out to the other soldiers, sharing them like a schoolboy shares stolen fruit. A click of the thumb primed each weapon and Rawne smiled to his men as he prepared to heave his into the air. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Varl's assessment is correct,' Rawne said. 'Let's blind them.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">They hefted the bombs into the sky. They were frag grenades, designed to deafen, blind and pepper those in range with needles of shrapnel. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There was the multiple crump of detonation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">That's got them ducking at least,' Caffran said, then realised that the others were already scrambling up out of the foxhole lo charge. He followed quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">Screaming, the Ghosts charged over a short stretch of grey ooze and then slithered down into a revetment, screened from them by the smoke. The blackened impacts of the grenades were all around them, as were the twisted bodies of several of their dead foe. Rawne slammed onto his feet at the bottom of the slide and looked around. For the first time in six months on Fortis Binary, he saw the enemy face to face. The Shriven, the ground forces of the enemy he had been sent here to fight. They were surprisingly human, but twisted and malformed. They wore combat armour cleverly adapted from the work suits that they had used in the forges of the planet, the protective masks and gauntlets actually woven into their wasted, pallid flesh. Eawne tried not to linger on the dead. It made him think too much about those legions he had still to kill. In the smoke he found two more of the Shriven, crippled by the grenade blasts. He finished them quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He found Caffran close behind him. The young trooper was shocked by what he saw. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They have lasguns,' Caffran said, aghast, 'and body armour.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Beside him, Neff turned one of the corpses over, with his toe. I lookâ€¦ they have grenades and munitions.' Neff and Caffran looked at the major. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rawne shrugged. 'So they're tough bastards. What did you expect? They've held the Imperium off here for six months.' Lonegin, Varl and Feygor hurried along to join them. Rawne waved them along, further into the enemy dugout. The space widened in front of them and they saw the metal-beamed, i None barns of an industrial silo. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rawne quickly gestured them into cover. Almost at once las-ire started to sear down the trench towards them. Varl was hit and his shoulder vanished in a puff of red mist. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He went down hard on his backside and then flopped over clutching with the | one arm that would still work. The pain was so momentous he couldn't even scream. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Feth!' spat Rawne. 'See to him, Neff!' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Neff was the squad medic. He pulled open his thigh pouch ctf field dressings as Feygor and Caffran tried to drag the whim-I pering Varl into cover. Gleaming lines of las-fire stitched the trench line and tried to pin them all. Neff quickly bound Varl's ghastly injury. We have to get him back, sir!' he shouted down the grey channel to Rawne. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rawne was pushing himself into the cover of the defile, the grey ooze matting his hair as the las-bursts burnt the air around him. 'Not now,' he said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Six</b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ibram Gaunt LEAPr down into the trench and broke the neck of the first Shriven he met with his descending boots. The chainsword screamed in his fist and as he reached the duck-boards of the enemy emplacement he swung it left and right to cut two more apart in drizzles of blood. Another charged him, a great curved blade in his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt raised his bolt-pistol and blew the masked head into vapour. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This was the thickest fighting Gaunt and his men had encountered on Fortis, caught in the frenzied narrows of the enemy trenches, sweeping this way and that to meet the incessant advance of the Shriven. Pinned behind the commissar, Brin Milo fired his own weapon, a compact automatic handgun that the commissar had given him some months before. He killed one - a bullet between die eyes - then another, winging him first and then putting a bullet into his upturned chin as he flailed backwards. Milo shivered. This was the horror of war that he had always dreamt of, yet never wished to see. Passionate men caught against each other in a dug out hole three metres wide and six deep. The Shriven were monsters, almost elephantine widi the long, nozzled gas masks sewn into the flesh of their faces. Their body armour was a dull industrial green and rubberised. They had taken the protective garb of their workspace and made it their battledress, daubing everything with eye-aching symbols. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Slammed against the trench wall by a falling body, Milo looked down at the corpses which gathered around them. He saw for the first time, in detail, the nature of his foeâ€¦ the twisted corrupted human forms of the Chaos host, incised with twisted runes and sigils, painted on the dull green rubber of their armour or carved into their raw flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the Shriven ploughed in past Gaunt's shrieking sword and dove himself at Milo. The boy dropped and the cultist smashed into the trench wall. Scrabbling in the muddy wetness</p>
<p class="calibre2">of the trench bed, Milo retrieved one of the lasguns that had fallen from the dying grasp of one of Gaunt's previous victims. The Shriven was on him as he hefted the weapon up and fired, point blank. The flaming round punched through his opponent's torso and the dead cultist fell across him, forcing him down by sheer weight into the sucking ooze of the trench floor. Foul water surged into his mouth, and mud and blood. A second later he was heaved, coughing, to his feet by Trooper Bragg, the most massive of the men of Tanith, who was somehow always there to watch over him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Get down,' Bragg said as he hoisted a rocket launcher onto his shoulder. Milo knelt and covered his ears, tight. Hopefully muttering the Litany of True Striking to himself, Bragg fired his huge weapon off down the companionway of the trench. A fountain of mud and other unnameable things were blown into fragments. He often missed what he was aiming at, but in these conditions that wasn't an option. </p>
<p class="calibre2">To their right, Gaunt was scything his way into the dose-packed enemy. He began to laugh, coated with the rain of blood that he was loosing with his shrieking chainsword. Every now and then he would fire his pistol and explode another of the Shriven. He was filled with fury. The signal from Lord General Dravere had been draconian and cruel. Gaunt would have wanted to take the enemy trenches if he could, but to be ordered to do so with no other option except death was, in his opinion, die decision of a flawed, brutal mind. He'd never liked Dravere, not at any time since their first meeting twenty years before, when Dravere had still been an ambitious armour colonel. Back on Darendara, back with Oktar and the Hyrkansâ€¦</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt had kept the nature of the orders from his men. Unlike Dravere, he understood the mechanisms of morale and inspiration. Now they were taking the damned trenches, almost in spite of Dravere's orders rather than because of them. His laughter was the laughter of fury and resentment, and pride in his men for doing the impossible regardless. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nearby, Milo stumbled to his feet, holding the lasgun. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We're there, Gaunt thought, we've broken them! </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ten yards down the line, Sergeant Blane leapt in with his platoon and sealed the event, blasting left and right with his lasgun as his men charged, bayonets first. There was a frenzy of las-fire and a flash of silver Tanith blades. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Milo was still holding the lasgun when Gaunt snatched it from him and threw it down onto the duckboards. 'Do you think you're a soldier, boy?' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, sir!' </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Really?' </p>
<p class="calibre2">"You know I am.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt looked down at the sixteen year-old boy and smiled sadly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Maybe you are, but for now play up. Play a tune that will sing us to glory!' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Milo pulled his Tanith pipes from his pack and breathed into the chanter. For a moment it screamed like a dying man. Then he began playing. It was Waltrab's Wilde, an old tune that had always inspired the men in the taverns of Tanith, to drink and cheer and make merry. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sergeant Blane heard the tune and with a grimace he laid into the enemy. By his side, his adjutant, vox-officer Symber, started to sing along as he blasted with his lasgun. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Trooper Bragg simply chuckled and loaded another rocket into the huge launcher that he carried. A moment later, another section of trench dissolved in a deluge of fire. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Trooper Caffran heard the music, a distant plaintive wail across the battlefield. It cheered him for a moment as he moved with the men under Major Rawne's direction up over the bodies of the Shriven, side by side with Neff, Lonegin, Larkin and the rest. Even now, poor Varl was being stretchered back to their lines, screaming as the drugs wore off. </p>
<p class="calibre2">That was the moment the bombardment started. Caffran found himself flying, lifted by a wall of air issued from a bomb blast that created a crater twelve metres wide. A huge slew of mud was thrown up in the sky with him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He landed hard, broken, and his mind frayed. He lay for a while in the mud, strangely peaceful. As far as he knew, Neff, Major Rawne, Feygor, Larkin, Lonegin, all the rest, were dead and vaporised. As shells continued to fall, Caffran sank his head into the slime and silently begged for release from his nightmare. </p>
<p class="calibre2">A long way off, Lord High Militant General Dravere heard the vast emplacements of the Shriven artillery begin their</p>
<p class="calibre2">onslaught. He realised that it would not be today, after all. Sighing angrily, he poured himself another cup from the freshly refilled samovar. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Seven</b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Colonel Corbec had three platoons with him and moved them forward into the traversed network of the enemy trenches. The bombardment had been howling over their heads for two hours now, obliterating the front edge of the Shriven emplacements and annihilating all those of the Guard who had not made it into the comparative cover of enemy positions. The tunnels and channels they moved through were empty and abandoned. Clearly the Shriven had pulled out as the bombardment began. The trenches were well-made and engineered, but at every turn or bend there was a blasphemous shrine to the Dark Powers that the enemy worshipped. Corbec had Trooper Skulane turn his flamer on each shrine they found and burn it away before any of his men could fully appreciate the grim nature of the offerings laid before it. </p>
<p class="calibre2">By Curral's estimation, after consulting the tightly-scrolled fibre-light charts, they were advancing into support trenches behind the Shriven main line. Corbec felt cut off </p>
<p class="calibre2">- not just by the savage bombardment that shook their very bones every other second, and he fervently prayed no shell would fall short into the midst of them - but more, he felt cut off from the rest of the regiment. The electro-magnetic aftershock of the ceaseless barrage was scrambling their communications, both the microbead intercoms that all the officers wore and the long range vox-caster radio sets. No orders were getting through, no urgings to regroup, to rendezvous with other units, to press forward for an objective, or even to retreat. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In such circumstances, the rulebook of Imperial Guard warfare was dear: if in doubt, move forward. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Corbec sent scouts ahead, men he knew were fast and able: Baru, Colmar and Scout-Sergeant Mkoll. They pulled their Tanith stealth cloaks around them and slipped away into the dusty darkness. Walls of smoke and powder were drifting back over the trench lines and visibility was dropping. Sergeant Blane gestured silently up at the billowing smoke banks that were descending. Corbec knew his intent, and knew that he didn't wish to voice it for fear of spooking the unit. The Shriven had no qualms about the use of poison agents, foul airborne gases that would boil the blood and fester the lungs. Corbec pulled out a whistle and blew three short blasts. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The men behind him put guns at ease and pulled respirators from their webbing. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Colonel Corbec buckled his own respirator mask around his face. He hated the loss of visibility, the claustrophobia of the thick-lensed gas hoods, the shortness of breath that the tight rubber mouthpiece provoked. But poison clouds were not the half of it. The sea of mud that the bombardment was agitating and casting up into the wind as vapour droplets was full of other venoms: the airborne spores of disease incubated in the decaying bodies out there in the dead zone; typhus, gangrene, livestock anthrax bred in the corrupting husks of pack animals and cavalry steeds, and the vicious mycotoxins that hungrily devoured all organic matter into a black, insidious mould. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As first officer to the Tanith First, Corbec had been privy to the dispatches circulated from the general staff. He knew that nearly eighty per cent of the fatalities amongst the Imperial Guard since the invasion began had been down to gas, disease and secondary infection. A Shriven soldier could face you point-blank with a charged lasgun and still your chances of survival would be better than if you took a stroll in no-man's land. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Muffled and blinkered by the mask, Corbec edged his unit on. They reached a bifurcation in the support trenches, and Corbec called up Sergeant Grell, officer of the fifth platoon, instructing him to take three fire-teams to the left and cleanse whatever they found. The men moved off and Corbec became aware of his increasing frustration. Nothing had come back from the scouts. He was moving as blind as he had been before he sent them out. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Advancing now at double time, the Colonel led his remaining hundred or so men along a wide communication trench. Two of his sharper-eyed vanguard moved in front, using magnetically sensitive wands attached to heavy backpacks to sweep for explosives and booby traps. It seemed that the Shriven had pulled back too rapidly to leave any surprises, but every few yards, the column stopped as one of the sweepers found something hot: a tin cup, a piece of armour, a canteen tray. Sometimes it was a strange idol made of smelt ore from the forge furnaces that the corrupted workers had carved into some</p>
<p class="calibre2">bestial form. Corbec personally put his laspistol to each one and blew it into fragments. The third time he did this, the wretched thing he was destroying blew up in sharp fragments as his round tore it open along some fault. Trooper Drayl, cowering a few feet away, was hit in the collarbone by a shard, which dug into the flesh. He winced and sat back in the mud, hard. Sergeant Curral called up the medic, who put on a field dressing. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Corbec cursed his own stupidity. He was so anxious to erase any trace of the Shriven cult he had hurt one of his own. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'It's nouÃ¼ng, sir/ Drayl said through his gas mask as Corbec helped him to his feet. 'At Voltis Watergate I took a bayonet in the thigh.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">'And back home on Tanith he got a broken bottle end in his cheek in a bar fight!' </p>
<p class="calibre2">laughed Trooper Coll behind them. 'He's had worse.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">The men around them laughed, ugly, sucking sounds through their respirators. Corbec nodded to show he was in tune with them. Drayl was a handsome, popular soldier whose songs and good humour kept his platoon in decent spirits. Corbec also knew that Drayl's roguish exploits were a matter of regimental legend. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'My mistake, Drayl,' Corbec said, 'I owe you a drink.' </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">'At the very least, colonel/ Drayl said and deftly armed his lasgun to show he was ready to continue. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Eight</b></p>
<p class="calibre2">They moved on. They reached a section of trench where a monumental shell had fallen short and blown the thin cavity open in a huge crater wound nearly thirty metres across. Already, brackish ground water was welling up in its bowl. With only the sweepers ahead of him, Corbec waded in first to lead them across into the cover where the trench recommenced. The water came up to his mid-thigh and was acidic. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He could feel it burning the flesh of his legs through his fatigues and there was a faint swirl of mist around the doth of his uniform as the fabric began to burn. He ordered the men behind him back and scrambled up on the far side to join the sweepers. The three of them looked down at their legs, horrified by the way the water had already begun to eat into the tunic doth. Corbec felt lesions forming on his thighs and shins. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He turned back to Sergeant Curral at the head of the column across the crater. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Move the men up and round!' he cried. 'And bring the medic over in the first party.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Afraid by the exposure of moving around the lip of the crater against the sky, the men traversed quickly and timidly. Corbec had Curral regroup them on the far side in fireteam lines along each side of the trench. The medic came to him and the sweepers, and sprayed their legs with antiseptic mist from a flask. The pain eased and the fabric was damped so that it no longer smouldered. Corbec was picking up his gun when Sergeant Grell called to him. He moved forward down the lines of waiting men and saw what Grell had found. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Colmar, one of the scouts he had sent forward. He was dead, hanging pendulously from the trench wall on a great, rusty iron spike which impaled his chest. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It was the sort of spike that the workers of the forge world would have used to wedge and manipulate the hoppers of molten ore in the Adeptus Mechanicus furnace works. </p>
<p class="calibre2">His hands and feet were missing. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Corbec gazed at him for a minute and then looked away. Though they had met no serious resistance, it was sickeningly dear that they weren't alone in these trenches. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Whatever the number of the Shriven still here, be it stragglers left behind or guerrilla units deliberately set to thwart them, a malicious presence was shadowing them in the gullies and channels of the support trenches. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Corbec took hold of the spike and pulled Colmar down. He took out the ground sheet from his own bedroll and rolled the pitiful corpse in it so that no one would see. He could not bring himself to incinerate the soldier, as he had done with the shrines. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Move on,' he instructed and Grell led the men forward behind the sweepers. Corbec suddenly stopped dead as if an insect had stung him. There was a rasping in his ear. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He realised it was his microbead link. He registered an overwhelming sense of relief that the radio link should be live at all even as he realised it was a short range broadcast from Mkoll, sergeant of the scouting unit. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Can you hear it, sir?' came Mkoll's voice. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">'Feth! Hear what?' Corbec asked. All he could hear was the ceaseless thunder of the enemy guns and the shaking tremors of the falling shells. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Drums/ Scout-Sergeant Mkoll said, 'I can hear drums.' </p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Nine</b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bajs, Milo heard the drums before Gaunt did. Gaunt valued his musician's almost preternaturally sharp senses, but they sometimes disturbed him nonetheless. The insight reminded him of someone. The girl perhaps, years ago. The one with the sight. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The one who had haunted his dreams for so many years afterwards. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Drums!' the boy hissed - and a moment later Gaunt caught Ae sound too. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They were moving through the silos and shelled-out struc-fcres of the rising industrial manufactories just behind the Shriven lines, sooty shells of melted stone, rusted metal girder-work and fractured ceramite. Gargoyles, built to ward the buildings against contamination, had been defaced or toppled completely. Gaunt was exceptionally cautious. The action of the day had played out unexpectedly. They had advanced far farther than he had anticipated from the starting point of a ample repulse of an enemy attack, thanks both to good fortune and Dravere's harsh directive. Reaching the front of  <i class="calibre4">the</i> enemy lines they had found them generally abandoned after  <i class="calibre4">zne</i> initial fighting, as if die majority of the Shriven had withdrawn in haste. Though a curtain of enemy bombardment cut cff dieir lines of retreat, Gaunt felt that the Shriven had made a great mistake and pulled back too far in uieir urgency to avoid bodi the Guard attack and their own answering artillery. /Either that or they were planning something. Gaunt didn't like lhat notion much. He had two hundred and thirty men with him in a long spearhead column, but he knew that if the I Shriven counterattacked now he might as well be on his own. As they progressed, they swept each blackened factory bunker, storehouse and forge tower for signs of the enemy, j Koving beneath flapping, torn banners, crunching broken jauined glass underfoot. Machinery had been stripped out and iKmoved, or simply vandalised. There was noticing whole left [here - apart from the Chaos shrines which the Shriven had [erected at regular intervals. Like Colonel Corbec, the commis-Isi had a flamer brought up to expunge any trace of these outrages. However, ironically, he was moving in exactly the opposite direction along the trench lines to Corbec's advance. Communication was lost and the breakthrough elements of the Tanith First and Only were wandering blind and undirected through what was by any estimation enemy territory. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The sound of the drums rolled in. Gaunt called up his vox-caster operator, Trooper Rafflan, and tersely barked into the speech-horn of the heavy backpack set, demanding to know if there was anyone out there. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The drums rolled. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There was a return across the radio link, an incomprehensible squawk of garbled words. At first, Gaunt thought the transmission was scrambled, but then he realised that it was another language. He repeated his demand and after a long painful silence a coherent message returned to him in clipped Low Gothic. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This is Colonel Zoren of the Vitrian Dragoons. We are moving in to support you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Hold your fire.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt acknowledged and then spread his men across the silo concourse in cover, watching and waiting. Ahead of them something flashed in the dull light and then Gaunt saw soldiers moving down towards them. They didn't see the Ghosts until the very last minute. With their tenacious ability to hide in anything, and their obscuring cloaks, Gaunt's Ghosts were masters of stealth camouflage. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dragoons approached in a long and carefully arranged formation of at least three hundred men. Gaunt could see that they were well-drilled, slim but powerful men in some kind of chain-armour that was strangely sheened and which caught the light like unpolished metal. Gaunt shrugged off the Tanith stealth cloak that had been a habitual addition to his garb since he joined the First and Only, and moved out of concealment, signalling them openly as he rose to his feet from cover. He advanced to meet the commanding officer. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Close to, the Vitrians were impressive soldiers. Their unusual body armour was made from a toothed metallic mail which covered them in form-fitting sections. It glinted like obsidian. Their helmets were full face and grim with narrow eye slits, glazed with dark glass. Their weapons were polished and clean. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Commissar Gaunt of the Tanith First and Only,' Gaunt said as he saluted a greeting. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Zoren of the Vitrian Dragoons/ came the reply. 'Good to see that there are some of you left out here. We feared we were being called in to support a regiment already slaughtered.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">The drums? Are they yours?' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Zoren slid back the visor of his helmet to reveal a handsome, dark-skinned face. He caught Gaunt with a quizzical stare. They are notâ€¦ we were just wondering what in the name of the Emperor it was ourselves.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt looked away into the smoke and the fractured buildings around them. The noise had grown. Now it sounded like hundreds of drumsâ€¦ thousandsâ€¦ from all around. </p>
<p class="calibre2">For each drum, a drummer. They were surrounded and completely outnumbered. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Ten</b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Caffran dragged himself across the mud and slid into a crater. Around him the bombardment showed no signs of easing. He had lost his lasgun and most of his kit, but he still had his silver knife and an auto-pistol that had come his way as a trophy at some time or other. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">Wriggling to the lip of the crater he caught sight of figures far away, soldiers who seemed to be dressed in glass. There was a full unit of them, caught in the crossfire of the serial bombardment. They were being slaughtered. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Shells fell close again and Caffran slid down to cover his head with his arms. This was hell and there was no way out of it. Curse this, in the name of Feth! </p>
<p class="calibre2">He looked up and grabbed his pistol as something fell into</p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">â– die</b> shell hole next to him. It was one of the glass-clad soldiers I he had seen from a distance, presumably one who had fled in</p>
<p class="calibre2">' search of cover. The man held up his hands to avoid Caffran's potential wrath. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Guard! I'm Guard, like you!' the man said hastily, pulling off I  <i class="calibre4">his</i> dark-lensed full-face helmet to reveal an attractive face with dan that was almost as dark and glossy as polished ebonwood. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Trooper Zogat of the Vitrian Regiment. We were called in to support you and half our number were in the open when the I artillery cranked up.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">'My sympathies,' Trooper Caffran said humourlessly, holster-I <b class="calibre3">ing</b> his pistol. He held out a pale hand to shake and was aware I of the way the man in the articulated metallic armour regarded I tfie blue dragon tattoo over his right eye with disdain. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Trooper Caffran, Tanith First/ he said. After a moment the Vitrian shook his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre2">A shell fell close and showered them in mud. Getting up from their knees they turned and looked out at the apocalyptic vista all around. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Well, friend/ Caffran said, 'I think we're here for the duration.' </p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Eleven</b></p>
<p class="calibre2">To the west, the Jantine Patricians moved in under the command of Colonel Flense. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They rode on Chimera personnel carriers that lurched and reeled across the slick and miry landscape. The Patricians were noble soldiers, tall men in deep purple uniforms dressed with chrome. Flense had been honoured when, six years before, he had become their commanding officer. They were haughty and resolute, and had won for him a great deal of praise. They had a regimental history that dated back fifteen generations to their first Founding in the castellated garrisons of Jant Normanidus Prime, generations of notable triumphs, and associations with illustrious generals and campaigns. There was just the one blemish on their honour roll, just the one, and it nagged at Flense day and night. He would rectify that. Here, on Fortis Binary. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He took his scope and looked at the battlefield ahead. He had two columns of vehicles with upwards of ten thousand men scissoring in to cut into the flank of the Shriven as the Tanith and the Vitrians drove them back. Both those regiments were fully deployed into the Shriven lines. But Flense had not counted on this bombardment from the Shriven artillery in the hills. Two kilometres ahead the ground was volcanic with the pounding of the macro-shells and a drizzle of mud fogged back to splatter their vehicles. There was no way of going round and Flense didn't even wish to consider the chances of driving his column through the barrage. Lord General Dravere believed in acceptable losses, and had demonstrated this practicality on a fair few number of occasions without compunction, but Flense wasn't about to commit suicide. </p>
<p class="calibre2">His scar twitched. He cursed. For all his manoeuvring with Dravere, this wasn't the way it was meant to go. He had been cheated of his victory. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Pull back!' he ordered into the vox handset and felt the gears of his vehicle grind into reverse as the carrier pulled around. </p>
<p class="calibre2">His second officer, a big, older man called Brochuss, glared at him under the low brim of his helmet. "We are to pull out, colonel?' he asked, as if obliteration by artillery shell was something he craved. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Shut up!' spat Flense and repeated the order into the vox-caster. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'What about Gaunt?' Brochuss asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What do you think?' Flense sneered, gesturing out of the Chimera's vision slit at the inferno that raged along the dead-land.  <i class="calibre4">*We</i> may not get glory today, but at least we can content ourselves in the knowledge that the bastard is dead.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Brochuss nodded, and a slow smile of consolation spread across his grizzled features. </p>
<p class="calibre2">None of the veterans had forgotten Khedd 1173. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Patrician armoured convoy snaked back on itself and thundered home towards friendly lines before the Shriven emplacements could range them. Victory would have to wait a while longer. The Tanith First and Only and the Vitrian support regiments were on their own. If there were indeed any of them left alive. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">A MEMORY</b></p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">GYLATUS</b> DECIMUS, <b class="calibre3">EIGHTEEN YEARS EARLIER</b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Oktar died slowly. It took eight days. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The commander had once joked - on Darendara, or was it Folion? Gaunt forgot. But he remembered the joke: 'It won't be war that slays me, it'll be these damn victory celebrations!' </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">They had been in a smoke-filled hall, surrounded by cheering citizens and waving banners. Most of the Hyrkan officers were drunk on their feet. Sergeant Gurst had stripped to his underwear and climbed the statue of the two-headed Imperial Eagle in the courtyard to string the Hyrkan colours from the crest. The streets were full of bellowing crowds, static, honking traffic and wild firecrackers. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Folion. Definitely Folion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Cadet Gaunt had smiled. Laughed, probably. </p>
<p class="calibre2">But Oktar had a way of being right all the time, and he had been right about this. The Instrumentality of the Gylatus World Flock had been delivered from the savage ork threat after ten months of sustained killing on the Gylatan moons. Oktar, Gaunt with him, had led the final assault on the ork war bunkers at Tropis Crater Nine, punching through the last stand resistance of the brutal huzkarl retinue of Warboss Elgoz. Oktar had personally planted the spike of the Imperial Standard into the soft grey soil of the crater bottom, through Elgoz's exploded skull. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then here, in the Gylatan hive city capital on Decimus, the victory parades, the hosts of jubilant citizenry, the endless festivities, the medal ceremonies, the drinking, the-The poison. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Canny, for orks. As if realising their untenable position, the orks had tainted the food and drink reserves in the last few days of their occupation. Taster servitors had sniffed most of it out, but that one stray bottle. That one stray bottle. Adjutant Broph had found the rack of antique wines on the second night of the liberation festivities, hidden in a longbox in the palace rooms which Oktar had commandeered as a playground for his officer cadre. No one had even thought-Eight were dead, including Broph, by the time anyone realised. Dead in seconds, collapsed in convulsive wracks, frothing and gurgling. Oktar had only just sipped from his glass when someone sounded the alarm. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One sip. That, and Oktar's iron constitution, kept him alive for eight days. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt had been off in the barracks behind the hive central palace, settling a drunken brawl, when Tanhause summoned him. Nothing could be done. </p>
<p class="calibre2">By the eighth day, Oktar was a skeletal husk of his old, robust self. The medics emerged from his chamber, shaking hopeless heads. The smell of decay and corruption was almost overpowering. Gaunt waited in the anteroom. Some of the men, some of the toughest Hyrkans he had come to know, were weeping openly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'He wants the Boy/ one of the doctors said as he came out, trying not to retch. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt entered the warm, sickly atmosphere of the chamber. Locked in a life-prolonging suspension field, surrounded by glowing fire-lamps and burning bowls of incense, Oktar was plainly minutes from death. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">Tbramâ€¦' The voice was like a whisper, a thing of no substance, smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Commissar-general.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">'It is past time for this. Well past time. I should never have left it to a finality like this. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I've kept you waiting too long.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Waiting?' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Truth of it is, I couldn't bear to lose youâ€¦ not you, Ibramâ€¦ far too good a soldier to hand away to the ladder of promotion. Who are you?' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gaunt shrugged. The stench was gagging his throat. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Cadet Ibram Gaunt, sir.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Noâ€¦ from now you are Commissar Ibram Gaunt, appointed in the extremis of the field to the commissarial office, to watch over the Hyrkan Regiments. Fetch a clerk. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We must record my authority in this matter, and your oath.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">Oktar willed himself to live for seventeen minutes more, as an Administratum clerk was found and the proper oath ceremony observed. He died clutching Commissar Gaunt's hands in his bony, sweat-oiled claws. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ibram Gaunt was stunned, empty. Something had been torn out of his insides, tom out and flung away. When he wandered out into the anteroom, he didn't even notice the soldiers saluting him. </p>
